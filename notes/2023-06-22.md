* What are the different cell types in the root?
* Tomatoes do endoreplication!
    * Endoreplication is crazy! Get 100 copies in one nucleus!
* Quiscent cells maintain the stem cell population
    * Divide really slowly?
    * When the plant is stressed, they switch and become the stem cells
* How to go from endocycle to differentiation?
    * Could just go from signal to differentiation?
