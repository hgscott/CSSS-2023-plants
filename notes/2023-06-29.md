* Cells get pushed
* How to model elongation
    * Start with just dividing in place
        * Can say that biologically we are modeling laterial root primordial
* Start with three lines- a stem cell for each line
* Steps
    1. 2D structure with uneven growth, but no division (Goal for summer school)
    2. 1D line of cells with stem cell on tip, asymmetrically dividing
    3. #2 plus elongation of differentiated cells at constant rate
    4. 2D extension
        * Hardocde roles for top and bottom
        * By spatial position
            * Semi-differentiated -> endocycle is determined by distance from tip (auxin gradient)
            * j=1, stem cells divide constants
            * i = 1,3
                * j=1,2 = fast division
                * j=3,4,5 = solw division
        * By age
            * Qualitative cell types
                * Semi-differentiated -> endocycle is determined by age
    5. Hormonal signals with diffusion (horizontal)
    6. Environmental gradient with diffusion (vertical)
* Biology we need to figure out
    * Cell fate specific elongation- how?
    * How is the auxin/cytokinin gradient working? Is there an environmental gradient?
        * Where are they coming from?
    * What determines growth rate?
        * Where is the sigar coming from?xs
