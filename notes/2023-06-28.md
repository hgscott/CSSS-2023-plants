# 2034-06-28: Meet with Chris
* Spatial scale: 1D or 2D?
* Diffusion term doesn't seem appropriate here (for cells, hormones can)
* What are the state variables
    * The different cell types
* Do you need the cell cycle?
    * Could just have some amount of division happening at each time step?
* Are the semi-differentiated cells pushing in a specific direction?
    * Are 
    * Current models are too bacterial for us
    * Jan's model for any polygon cell
* Who's making the signal for going from SC to EC?
    * Do meristem cells produce auxin?
        * Simplest, make a constant rate, just diffuses
* Signaling between the types is necessary, but the cell cycle may not be
    * Could add it later, if needed
* Cellular automata based
    * Have a grid, on every grid cell have a particle of a different flavor
    * Rules
        * If you're SC, divide, lay a SC out front, EC behind
    * Based on a neighborhood
    * How to set it up so it isn't just trivial?
        * Stochastic processes would make it more interesting
    * Put the signals in the rules
    * The pushing part is NOT in the standard cellular automata modeling
